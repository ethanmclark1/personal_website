If  you were to ask me to perform bubble sort on an array five years ago,  then I would’ve ignored you. If you were to ask me to explain what a  linked list is, I would’ve told you to stop talking to me. If you were  to ask me what the time complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm is, I surely  would’ve kneecapped you.

Why?  Because the only thing that I cared about was basketball. It was my  dream, for as long as I could remember, to play professional basketball.  I didn’t know nor care about 1’s and 0’s — that was for the Smart People  and I simply, well I wasn’t one of them. Little did I know, my dream of  playing professional basketball would be crushed through no fault but  my own… I was kicked off my high school basketball team for making an  inappropriate joke about the head varsity coach’s wife and to my luck, they both found out. I was immediately kicked off the team; during our conversation, he told me that I would never  be playing basketball for his program again. My solution was to  transfer to a different school but I wasn’t accepted anywhere else. That  was the end of my childhood fantasy.

With  basketball out of the picture, I had to find a different passion. For  the next year or so I became the quintessence of a high-school stoner; I  didn’t do much. However, I did discover Fallout 4 and began playing it  religiously for a while. I did well in school but then again it was just  high school, not a whole lot of effort was required. As for my life  plan — I didn’t have one. I didn’t need one. I was comfortable with  getting high and playing video games — it was an easy life, one I could  get used to. Then one day, while sitting in my psychology class learning  about schizophrenia; I decided I was going to become a psychiatrist to  learn all about cognition, I thought the mind was an interesting enigma and I needed to understand it in its entirety.

I decided to bring this up with my family and hear what they had to say…  well, to summarize what happened next: the idea was shot down faster  than a Soviet spy plane flying over the White House. Now, with all due  respect to psychologists — I think it is a fascinating and necessary  profession, but you have to consider that both of my parents are  electrical engineers, as well as my stepdad. So the social sciences just  didn’t cut it and I was back to the drawing board.

Fast  forward a year later. While sitting in my Algebra 3–4 class, a teacher  from down the hall came in to talk about an event called “National Hour of Coding.” She showed us a commercial for  the event that I would never forget — Chris Bosh was in it. If it  wasn’t for him, this memory would’ve been long gone. The moment was  serendipitous. I didn’t have anything going on after school that day, so  I decided to go to that event. We were programming with Scratch: the  most basic programming. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it. I thought it might be  something worth looking into, so I did. I got home and looked up the  salary for a computer scientist. It was $90,000 a year and in all  honesty, this was the reason why I chose to pursue this path.

At  this time, my brother was in a fraternity at Arizona State University  and with me being the copycat younger brother that I was, I wanted to  become a frat guy, too. From junior year of high school onward, I  cultivated the persona of a Frat Guy. Then, when college came around, I  ended up joining one, too. You guessed it, I joined my brother’s frat.  It was your stereotypical frat portrayed in movies like American Pie —  rowdy and obnoxious.

Overall,  it was a good time and I’m glad I was able to share that with him.  However, towards the end of my sophomore year, I began to grow tired of  the infinite loop that meant: go to school, go home, get drunk, go to  sleep at 3 AM, and repeat. I wasn’t sure of any alternatives, but I was  sure I needed to find one. At the time, nearly all of my friends were  either members of or associated with my frat so it would be pretty  difficult to do anything different. Towards the end of the winter  semester, one day, I was sitting in a lecture and not paying attention  to a single thing being taught, instead, I was watching videos about psychedelics on YouTube.  Then some dude sitting behind me tapped on my shoulder and proceeded to  show pictures of his peyote and mescaline cacti, along with his  psilocybin mushroom collection. We spoke for a while, shared contact  info, then went our separate ways after class to not speak again for  some time.

A  couple of weeks later I decided to message him to see if he had any  shrooms. He did, I went to his place, and let me tell you — he was a  psychedelic, Walter White. Shrooms, peyote, mescaline, and DMT. He had  it all. I eventually got what I came for and went home. The next week I  had planned to take them and when that day came, to tell you the truth, I  was nervous. I hadn’t tried any psychedelics yet, but I knew everything  there was to know about them. I was so certain I was going to try them,  but it didn’t stop me from being nervous.

When I finally got around to it, the experience was nothing short of  revolutionary. It made me discover the important things in life. It  opened my eyes to the superficial nature of being in Greek Life, it made  me realize that I did not want to be that person anymore. I didn’t want  to balance being the “cool, frat guy who doesn’t care about anything”  with “the nerd that loves to learn.” I decided I was going to be  absolute; I was going to drop my frat and fully commit to the way of the  nerd. This was a huge turning point in my life — it solidified my  identity. I became who I am today from this one decision; it was the  butterfly effect in action. I have found new interests and hobbies that I  don’t think I would have considered before. For instance, artificial  intelligence.

This epiphany had me thinking more about what I wanted to do with my life, I  knew I wanted to contribute something to this world before I die. Make a  name for myself and have that name written down in history — preferably  a Wikipedia page, because to have a Wikipedia page you can’t be just  another Joe Shmoe on the side of the street. No, you have to do  something notable enough for people to care about you. This, right here,  is what began to motivate me; it’s where artificial intelligence and  Lincoln, Nebraska come into the picture.

I have a list of three things that I find to be the most interesting in  the world. Coming in at number one is psychedelics, but right behind  that is artificial intelligence: the idea of creating an intelligent  machine simply by feeding a computer with strings of 1’s and 0’s is the  most extraordinary concept. Could you imagine trying to explain that to a  caveman? Where would you even begin? It’s commonly argued that the AI  singularity will be the single, most impactful thing humanity will ever  see. I’m not going to go into detail on why that is, since that is not  the point of this. The point is to show how one trivial decision I made  two years ago changed the course of my life — how it helped me discover a  new passion and provided my life with purpose. To quote Jessica from  Rick and Morty, “time without a purpose is a prison.” I am freed from  that prison.

Now  that you’ve been briefed with Spark Notes on my past five years, I  moved to Lincoln, Nebraska this summer to research autonomous vehicles  at the University of Nebraska. I deeply enjoy the work that I am doing —  I never thought that the statement “choose a job you love and you’ll  never have to work a day in your life” was true until I started working  here. I hope that everyone can find their passion and sense of purpose  in life — I hope they act on it and experience the same sort of joy I  have felt.

Five  years ago if you would have said that future me would be working with  reinforcement learning on autonomous vehicles in Lincoln, Nebraska — can  you guess what I would’ve done? Who cares, I’m here anyways.

The  moral of the story is to take shrooms to shed the skin of your old  self. Just kidding, I have to keep it PG. The true moral of the story is  up to your interpretation…

Seriously,  there are a lot of things that I have learned over the past five years  but the most important thing: just be yourself, don’t fall victim to the  mimetic theory.  You shouldn’t let other peoples opinion’s on you stop you from being  you, because at the end of the day, who cares what they think. Lastly,  it’s good to be a contrarian sometimes.
