There  are so many extraordinary things in life that we take for granted. Like  how we can throw an object at a distant target without having to  calculate the force, how our brains can focus on one voice after hearing  our name called in a crowd of voices, or the mere existence of prime  numbers. I can go on all day compiling a list of things that we take for  granted, but by the end of it, the list would be as long as the line to  buy tickets for a Justin Bieber concert in 2016. One thing I want to  single out is randomness — it’s such a simple and amazing idea that I,  for one, never truly considered up until recently.

Without  the existence of randomness, there would be no human life because  evolution requires that there are random mutations in the genetic code  so that mutated species can out-compete for resources and be naturally  selected to survive. No randomness means no evolution which means no  humans; Earth without randomness would be desolate, the only thing  present would be the most basic single-celled organisms. In biology,  randomness is the most fundamental idea that allows for everything else  to follow.

Randomness  is ingrained in our reality. Over the years, computer scientists and  mathematicians alike have worked tirelessly to come as close as possible  to replicating perfect randomness; however, to perfectly replicate  randomness on a modern computer is fundamentally impossible. John Von  Neumann, the father of modern computing, put it simply:

“Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.”

Anytime  you use a random number generator it’s actually only producing  pseudo-random numbers that follow a predictable pattern and this is  because of the way computers are built [1] — they must follow  deterministic paths. Even with our most advanced tools, we still cannot  hope to replicate true randomness.

Moving  to the artificial intelligence domain now, random search algorithms can  compete with and, in some cases, outperform state-of-the-art  reinforcement learning algorithms on designated tasks [2]. This means  the best of the best algorithms, that some of the most gifted  individuals have helped develop, can still be outperformed by something  that is performing randomly.

Randomness  is a simple yet extraordinary phenomenon that is integral to human  life, has been around forever but is inimitable. It is the things like  this that I marvel at because it makes me wonder how they can be programmed into our reality. Kind of like math being discovered and not  created…
