Don’t  worry, this isn’t going to be some piece explaining why I think we live  in a simulation (although, I do think that). This is more so going to  be me talking about how I think we should go about our lives.

Back  when I was in high school, I was a bit of a gamer. I was invested in  games like Fallout, GTA, and Skyrim. Each of these titles has one thing  in common — they’re all role-playing games (RPG). I was drawn to these  games because of their inherent character building; I had the freedom to  do whatever, customize my character in any way, and track my progress,  easily, through in-game accolades. The last video game I played  religiously was Fallout 4 — it’s my gold standard for video games. I can  recall, in my sophomore year of high school, I would come home and  devote countless hours to this game. When I wasn’t playing I was either  thinking about the next chance I got to play it, my character's future  game plan, or reliving my character's past experiences. There’s no doubt  I was textbook addicted.

After  countless days spent playing Fallout 4, I finally beat the game. I was  so relieved, it was like a weight was lifted on my shoulders and I could  finally move my sights onto a new game. But, then I began to reflect on  the experience. I reflected on the past couple of months of playing and  my in-game accomplishments. I thought about how these achievements were  now useless and meant nothing. I thought about how the skills I picked  up could not be transferred or translated to any other domain. None  of the stuff I earned or spent hours working towards in the game meant  anything now; it was during this post-game clarity that I decided I  would move away from video games.

Since  then, I sold my PS4 and I haven’t looked back. I shifted my focus away  from games like Fallout and more towards the game of life. As a result  of this shift, I began viewing life as a video game and what I mean by  that is everything I had wanted in a video game is evidently ingrained  in real life. Choosing my adventure, customizing myself, and tracking my  progress. These are all characteristics of life. The turnaround time  may be longer but the results are tangible thus making it more  rewarding.

By  viewing life as a video game, it opens you up to a world of new  possibilities. If you think you would enjoy being a musician but have  never played an instrument, well then level up your music abilities and  rise through the leader boards. If you think you’d want to be a UFC  fighter, well then level up your fighting skills and compete for the  crown. If you think it would be cool to run a marathon… I’m sure you get  the idea by now.

Here  are the three main points I’m trying to hammer home from this. First,  the only person that’s stopping you from evolving yourself is you, life  is a choose your own adventure. It may not seem like that when you’re so  dialed in and focused on the task at hand — but if you take a step  back, then you’ll realize the world is your oyster. Second, be as  eclectic as you want. Your labels should not define you; in fact, you  shouldn’t even adopt any labels, to begin with, because then you’ll be  constrained to that label. For instance, if I were to label myself as a  computer scientist (this is what I’m going to school for), then it would  be uncharacteristic of me to write non-technically. I would be  deviating from my expected path as that is not something you would  expect from your average computer scientist. Therefore, I would not do  it since I want to keep my identity; but, because I am not defined by  the fact that I go to school for computer science this allows me to be  as fluid as I want. Third, gamify your life to make it more engaging and  fun. Think of your life in levels — for me, I’m still in school and I  will most likely be for the next 5+ years. The way I keep myself engaged  is by thinking about it like I’m still in the tutorial stage. I need to  acquire the necessary tools, information, and skills before I can go  out on my own adventure to slay the metaphorical dragon.
