Just  six months ago, I viewed writing as a chore. Throughout my whole life I  hated it and I was never any good at it, which made it even more  annoying. Outside of texting, the only time I would ever write anything  would be the occasional email to a professor or when required to for a  homework assignment. I never practiced writing anything therefore I  could never improve upon my skills. Every time I needed to send an  email, I would write it up and then ask my family members to look it  over, to make sure it was up to par; sometimes I would even just give my  siblings a general email idea, then they would write it out for me. I  was self-conscious about my writing ability and looking back on it, it  makes sense because the last real writing class I took was in my junior  year of high school where I wasn’t interested in learning how to write  at all, and as a result, I didn’t retain any of the information. I went  five years without taking a writing class… how could I have been any good?

This  past summer, I was a part of a research internship program and as  homework, we had to write weekly journals of what we accomplished, what  recreational activities we did, and what we planned to do the next week.  This activity opened up my eyes to show me just how stupendously bad of  a writer I was. I didn’t know any of the rules and I wasn’t good at  telling stories. It’s especially a shame because I’m a native English  speaker, yet I knew nothing about writing. Sentence fragments,  subject-verb agreement, parallel structure, participles, etc. All of  these concepts I’ve heard before, but they meant nothing to me and  sounded more like pig-Latin than anything else. For the first few weekly  journals I wrote, I kept them short because I didn’t want to make it  obvious that I wasn’t good at writing, but after a couple of weeks, I  successively wrote longer entries until I ultimately began looking  forward to writing them each week.

After I finished up the summer internship, I went back home to Arizona and decided to write my first ever Medium article “How I Ended Up in Lincoln, Nebraska”  I knew it was going to be far from perfect but I didn’t let that  discourage me, because creating a piece of garbage and continually  refining it is much easier than creating a masterpiece. Throughout this  process, I learned to enjoy being bad at things because all it means is  that you have the opportunity to get that much better. I believe this to  be an invaluable lesson in life — you shouldn’t get discouraged when  you’re bad at something, instead take it as a challenge to become  better; with this mindset, you will be able to accomplish whatever you  set your mind to.

I’d  recommend writing to any and everyone, I don’t care if you’re a  plumber, caregiver, or even a professional fart smeller (it’s a real job)  because writing has tons of benefits. The most attractive one is that  it’s for your future self. If you write about your thoughts, beliefs, or  even just how you’re feeling, then it can function as a time capsule  for you in the future. Imagine you’re 75 years old and you come across  something you wrote back in your early 20’s, it wouldn’t even have to be  anything magnificent but I’m willing to bet that you’d have a smile  form across your face as you begin reading it. So do your future self  the favor and start writing, otherwise, you will regret it when you’re  older.

On  top of that, writing is therapeutic. You never truly understand how you  feel about something until you write about it and if you don’t believe  me, then go ahead and prove me wrong, give it a try. Either way, you  have nothing to lose. The only two possibilities are that you’re right  and you get an ego boost or you’re wrong and the ball is rolling for you  to continue writing. You don’t have to post your writing online either,  just keep it saved for yourself. The reason I like to post what I write  online is that it’ll be stuck on the internet forever and anyone can  read it; therefore, I’m forced to try my best because I don’t want some  hogwash to be tied to my identity for the rest of eternity.

Throughout  my six-month journey of writing, I have come a long way. I’m not  ashamed to say I’m still trash at it but the future is promising. I  still do not understand sentence fragments, subject-verb agreements,  parallel structure, and participles nor do I have any care in the world  to understand them but at least, I am not self-conscious about my  writing ability anymore because that’s all I wanted to accomplish from  this. I hope my story was able to inspire you readers to start writing  and hey, maybe I’ll even come across one of your Medium articles one  day.
