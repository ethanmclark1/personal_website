          I love bringing people together. I founded Phoenix Builds, a community event that became a genuine 
          third place for builders, regularly drawing 40-50 people to work, collaborate, and connect. During undergrad, I 
          started a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5mmKM5FcamoamUu9fflTnw?si=f9c285411c4d4f2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 hover:underline">podcast</a> as 
          an excuse to meet compelling people. These days, I'm also active in Toastmasters, 
          working on becoming a clearer communicator.

          I'm deeply interested in health and longevity. I recently took up boxing 
          and I'm now preparing for my first amateur fight. I also play basketball and
          hike regularly. After developing celiac disease with no family history,  
          I dove into nutrition science and began exploring how stress manifests in the body, which led me 
          to investigate somatic therapy and the intimate connections between mind and body.

          In the classic explore-exploit dilemma, I lean heavily toward exploration. I grow bonsai trees and experiment 
          with hydroponics and mycology, finding that these slow, deliberate pursuits provide a counterweight 
          to our hyperconnected age. I've also rediscovered reading after a 15-year hiatus. 
          I'm currently making my way through literary classics like Dostoevsky, alongside sci-fi favorites like the Dune series and Ender's Quintet. 
          Always happy to trade recommendations.
