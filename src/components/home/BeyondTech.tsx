        Outside of work, I stay active through basketball and hiking, 
        and I'm passionate about growing things â€” from bonsai trees and hydroponics to mycology. 
        The patience required for bonsai is a nice counterbalance to our fast-paced digital world!

        After years of thinking reading wasn't cool, 
        I've rediscovered books and am currently exploring sci-fi classics.
        I also enjoy learning about nutrition, fitness, and how history connects to what's happening today.

        I love bringing people together and believe some of the best conversations happen over shared interests.
        Recently, I've been getting into Toastmasters to improve my public speaking skills and meet people from different walks of life. 
        Always open to book recommendations or conversations about any of these topics!
