            Hi, I'm Ethan â€” an ML researcher pursuing my 
            master's in computer science at Arizona State University. At the Cooperative Robotic 
            Systems Lab, I work on theoretical reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems under 
            Dr. Yu Zhang's guidance.

          <p>
            Currently, I'm working on imitation learning for bipedal locomotion at IHMC, where
            I'm helping develop control systems for humanoid robots. Previously, I was at Crow 
            Industries developing autonomous navigation systems for unmanned ground vehicles.

            My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics,
            with a particular focus on humanoid robotics, multi-agent systems, and embodied AI.
