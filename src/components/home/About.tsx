          Hi, I'm Ethan â€” an ML engineer at <a href="https://www.luckyrobots.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 hover:underline">Lucky Robots</a> where I work as a Research Engineer specializing in Embodied AI.
          I completed my master's degree in computer science at Arizona State University, 
          where I researched theoretical reinforcement learning for multi-agent systems under the advisement of <a href="https://www.public.asu.edu/~yzhan442/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 hover:underline">Dr. Yu Zhang</a> in the <a href="https://www.public.asu.edu/~yzhan442/CRS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 hover:underline">Cooperative Robotic Systems Lab</a>.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Prior to joining Lucky Robots, I worked on imitation learning for bipedal locomotion at <a href="https://robots.ihmc.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 hover:underline">IHMC</a>, where
          I helped develop control systems for humanoid robots. I also gained experience at <a href="https://www.crowindustriesinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 hover:underline">Crow Industries</a> developing autonomous navigation systems for unmanned ground vehicles.

          My professional interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics,
          focusing on humanoids and embodied learning.
          I'm particularly interested in developing humanoids for elderly care, revitalizing the American industrial base, and saving military lives.
